## Story behind the Shadow Bootstrapper.

This was originally designed for Shadow in 2020-2021, we paid a designer known as "Laxion" to design the interface for us with complete rights to the interface. This designer ended up reselling it due to the fact that we weren't using it. It's now released free to use for anyone.

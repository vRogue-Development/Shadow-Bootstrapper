## Story behind the Shadow Bootstrapper.

This was originally designed for Shadow in 2020-2021, we paid a designer known as "Laxion" to design the interface for us with complete rights to the interface. This designer ended up reselling it due to the fact that we weren't using it and <b>terrible developers</b> like Nihon got a hold of it. So we are therefore releasing the design for everyone to use, it cost us a lot of money, but it's better off being public than it is being used by developers like Nihon.
